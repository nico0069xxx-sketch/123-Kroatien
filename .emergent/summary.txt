**what currently exists?**
The project is a Django monolith in  with fragile CSS and URL structures. A significant amount of work was completed in this session:
1.  A new, secure, token-based password reset system was implemented for all users, replacing an insecure OTP-based one. This includes all necessary views (), URLs, and multi-lingual templates.
2.  The root cause of the logo display bug was identified: media files are not served in Django's development server when . The user was instructed to use  for local development.
3.  A new, detailed, trilingual (DE/HR/EN) user guide for Gruppe A (Makler) was created and linked in their dashboard.
4.  The Corporate Identity (CI) was unified across the Gruppe A () and Gruppe B () dashboards, standardizing colors and correcting German Umlaute.
5.  The  file was updated to exclude  and the  directory, preventing future merge conflicts.
6.  The Partner werden landing page was made fully trilingual (DE/HR/EN), using the final approved design and content.

**Last working item**:
The agent just finished implementing the final, fully trilingual (DE/HR/EN) version of the Partner werden (Become a Partner) landing page. This involved restoring the correct version from git history, adding English translations for all text, and correcting a statistic to 30+ Years Experience.

-   Last item agent was working: Finalizing and pushing the trilingual partner landing page.
-   Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   Agent Testing Done: Y (The agent guided the user to test the page with , which worked).
-   Which testing method agent to use? Manual testing by user. The user has pushed the branch  and should now create and merge the Pull Request on GitHub. After merging, they should verify the page again on their local server.
-   User Testing Done: N (Pending PR merge and final check).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Critical CSS Instability (P0 - RECURRING BLOCKER)**
    -   Description: The project's CSS is extremely fragile. Changes frequently break the layout. This is the highest priority technical debt to resolve.
    -   Status: NOT STARTED
    -   Is recurring issue?: Y
-   **Issue 2: Brittle  Model (P2)**
    -   Description: A previous crash was caused by a missing  database object. A hotfix was applied, but the root cause is unsolved.
    -   Status: NOT STARTED
    -   Is recurring issue?: N
-   **Issue 3:  Dropdown Styling (P2)**
    -   Description: Filter dropdowns use a legacy plugin that is difficult to style.
    -   Status: NOT STARTED
    -   Is recurring issue?: Y

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   **(P1) Explain Social Media Integration:** The user asked how and where providers add their social media links. This needs to be documented, likely by adding a section to both the Gruppe A and Gruppe B user guides. The functionality is described in the new Gruppe A guide, but the user wants it explained.
    -   **(P2)** Mobile View Optimization: Fine-tune the new dashboards (),  pages, and  for mobile devices.
    -   **(P2)** Enhance Gruppe B User Guide: The new Gruppe A guide is more detailed (e.g., has a table of contents). The Gruppe B guide () should be updated to match this new, improved structure.
    -   **(P2)** Investigate OpenAI Chatbot capabilities for service providers.
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   **(P0)** Refactor URL Architecture.
    -   **(P1)** Implement Review/Rating System.
    -   **(P2)** Implement Meta Pixel Tracking.
    -   **(P2)** Consolidate legacy code.
